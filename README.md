Executive Summary
This report investigates the stock market performance of North American airline firms, with a specific focus on Air Canada, during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The aviation industry faced unprecedented challenges due to travel restrictions, passenger hesitancy, and economic uncertainty. This study applies a quantitative research approach using data from 15 airline companies, gathered from Investing.com, and analyzed using Python and SPSS tools. The research methodology includes trend analysis, correlation analysis, and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to compare stock performance between the two waves.
Key findings reveal that stock prices across most airlines dropped significantly during the first wave, with volume spikes indicating panic-driven trading. The second wave exhibited more stable trading behavior, suggesting investor adaptation. Air Canada, along with 13 other airlines, showed statistically significant differences in adjusted close prices between the waves, while Cargojet was an exception, reflecting its unique market resilience.
The report concludes that investor sentiment evolved with time, and that government support played a key role in sector recovery. The study provides practical recommendations for investors such as diversification, risk management, and monitoring government policies. Theoretical recommendations include further exploration of behavioral finance and crisis-impact modeling. Overall, this research offers critical insights into stock market behavior during global disruptions and contributes to future crisis preparedness for both investors and policymakers.
